ToscaLabs is a project focused on developing software solutions that address
challenges in social contexts.

Our competence lies in leveraging modern programming language and cutting-edge
technologies to build versatile libraries and innovative tools.

Founded and managed by Michele Valsesia, ToscaLabs pays close attention to
social issues where computer science can offer effective solutions, with the
hope that our items can be of any help to others.

paragraph = """
One night, a friend of mine had a dream in which we co-founded a company
together called _Tosca_.

Eventually, that friend took a different path, but the name lingered
in the recesses of my mind.

One day, an unnamed little creature appeared out of nowhere, offering to
accompany us on our journey. Filled with joy, our new friend chose to embrace
the name Tosca.

The suffix _Labs_ in the tech world conveys a sense of innovation, a research 
and development mindset, and a constant pursuit of new ideas.

In the picture, we can see _Tosca_ in great shape.

title = "1. Problem Analysis"
description = """
A preliminary meeting to discuss your **problem** and evaluate whether it can be
addressed through computer science.

As the conversation progresses, a more detailed **description** of the problem will emerge,
as its **ambiguities** and **difficulties** are identified.
"""

title = "2. Solution Design"
description = """
Based on the problem description, a **potential solution** will be proposed.

This is an iterative process that may require additional meetings to
fully define the **project** and its future development.

However, be aware: this stage may also result in the **absence** of a solution.

title = "3. Code Writing"
description = """
Once the project outline is complete, it is time to write the software **code**,
whether for a library or a tool.

As a general rule, **maintainable** and **well-documented** code is always preferred
over disorganized and incomprehensible code.
"""

[[extra.cards]]
title = "4. Software Testing"
description = """
The final stage involves executing all **automated tests** to verify the
**correctness** of the developed software.

These tests will be designed based on the **requirements** gathered during the
_Solution Design_ stage and will also consider the potential **use cases** of
the software.
