The framework provides APIs for developing **firmware** for a variety
of hardware architectures, as well as APIs for creating **software** that
interacts with these devices.
"""

title = "Customizable"
description = """
Most APIs can be seen as code blocks, each encapsulating a
single **feature** or a set of related **features**. These blocks can be easily
combined by adding or removing lines of code, allowing the final software to be
**customized** based on developer needs.

title = "Secure"
description = """
Written in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
a language renowned for its **performance**, **memory management**, and
**vulnerability prevention**, all features that significantly minimize
errors during software development.
Furthermore, the APIs are subjected to **automated tests** designed to identify
a wide range of pathological and physiological errors present within the
framework.
"""

[[extra.cards]]
title = "Documented"
description = """
All APIs are **documented** with a description and a list of errors
that may occur in specific situations. The framework also provides
**examples** to illustrate the correct use of APIs during software
development.
