# ToscaLabs Website

A simple static website for the [ToscaLabs](https://github.com/ToscaLabs)
organization.

# Prerequisites

Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) from its `master` branch, following the
steps outlined on this
[installation page](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/#from-source).

# Serve the site

To serve the website locally, run:

```console
zola serve [--open]
```

This starts a local development server and serves the site at the address shown
in the terminal (typically `http://127.0.0.1:1111/`).

If you include the `--open` flag, the site will automatically open in your
default web browser.
